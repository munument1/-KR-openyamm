# OpenYAMM Android Build

This Android project builds an SDL3-based OpenYAMM APK.

- Debug builds include `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` for emulator testing.
- Release builds include only `arm64-v8a` for production sideloading.
- APK assets are mounted from the installed APK. Large runtime asset packages are not extracted to app storage.

The project expects an SDL3 source tree. By default it uses the desktop build's
fetched SDL checkout at:

```text
../build/_deps/sdl3-src
```

Build a debug APK from the repository root using the lightweight wrapper:

```sh
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 android/gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Or point at a different SDL3 source checkout:

```sh
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 android/gradlew :app:assembleDebug -POPENYAMM_SDL3_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/SDL
```

The Android SDK must be discoverable through `ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`,
or `android/local.properties`.

The expected debug output is:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Android builds package `android/settings.ini` as the first-launch settings profile. The installed app copies that
profile to its app-specific external `settings.ini` only when the file is missing. Saves and settings are stored under
`Android/data/org.openyamm.android/files/`, where they can be copied through USB file transfer. Android may restrict
on-device file managers from browsing this directory, and uninstalling the app removes it. Profile-version migrations
update Android-required defaults without replacing user-adjustable settings.

To build, start/reuse an emulator, install, launch, and follow logs:

```sh
android/run_debug_emulator.sh
```

Useful overrides:

```sh
OPENYAMM_AVD_NAME=openyamm_api35 android/run_debug_emulator.sh
ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk android/run_debug_emulator.sh
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 android/run_debug_emulator.sh
```

## Release APK

Release signing can be configured through `android/signing.properties`, Gradle
properties, or the `OPENYAMM_ANDROID_*` environment variables. For local builds,
the release script can create `android/keystores/openyamm-release.jks`.

```sh
android/build_release_apk.sh
```

Outputs:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
android/app-release.apk
```

To build an optimized x86_64 release APK, start or reuse the configured emulator, install the APK, launch it, and
follow logs:

```sh
android/run_release_emulator.sh
```

The emulator runner signs this local release build with the standard Android debug keystore. It does not replace
`android/app-release.apk`, which is reserved for the production-signed hosted build. Pass `--no-logcat` to return after
launching the game.

Useful release-runner overrides:

```sh
OPENYAMM_BUILD_RELEASE_APK=0 android/run_release_emulator.sh
OPENYAMM_ANDROID_UNINSTALL_ON_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH=0 android/run_release_emulator.sh
OPENYAMM_ANDROID_RELEASE_ABIS=arm64-v8a android/run_release_emulator.sh
```

For manual public builds, bump `openyamm.android.versionName` and `openyamm.android.versionCode` in
`android/gradle.properties`. Tagged CI builds derive both values from an `X.Y` release tag. See
`android/WEB_HOSTING_CHECKLIST.md` for the hosted APK checklist.

## Package CI Signing

Android shaders target OpenGL ES 3.0, matching the manifest's minimum renderer requirement.
The build generates `AndroidShaderPaths.h` from the CMake runtime shader list. Startup checks
the extracted files against the APK contents and updates missing or changed shaders, including
changes that preserve file size. User settings and saves remain in the existing external directory.

CI installs the published 0.12 APK, updates it with the signed ARM64 release APK in an Android 15
emulator with ARM64 translation, and loads Regna before making the APK available for publication.
This also verifies that the production signing identity permits an in-place update. The check requires successful
renderer initialization and verifies every extracted shader against the APK; reaching the main
menu alone is insufficient. Logs and a screenshot are retained as a CI artifact.

Run the same check on a disposable emulator (it replaces that emulator's game settings):

```sh
python3 android/test_release_apk.py android/app-release.apk \
  --serial emulator-5554 --output /tmp/openyamm-android-test
```

To test an in-place update, add `--baseline-apk <previous.apk> --save <save.oysav>`.
Both APKs must use the same signing certificate, and the candidate must have a higher version
code. The test installs with `adb install -r`, checks that settings and save bytes survive,
and loads that save. Use `--world` and `--map` when testing another world or map.

For a release build using already prepared asset ZIPs outside the ordinary `assets/` directory,
pass `-Popenyamm.android.runtimeAssetsDir=/absolute/path` to Gradle. The directory must contain
`engine.zip` and `worlds/{mm6,mm7,mm8,mmmerge}.zip`.

The GitHub Actions workflow uses the same signed release path for nightly and tagged packages. Configure these
repository secrets before running it:

- `OPENYAMM_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: the release keystore encoded as one-line base64
- `OPENYAMM_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: the keystore password

The workflow expects the release script's default `openyamm` key alias and uses the keystore password as the key
password. A keystore created by `android/build_release_apk.sh` has those defaults. On Linux, encode it with:

```sh
base64 -w 0 android/keystores/openyamm-release.jks
```

On Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("android\keystores\openyamm-release.jks"))
```

Keep the keystore and secrets backed up. Every published update for `org.openyamm.android` must use the same signing
key; replacing it requires users to uninstall the existing app before installing the new build.
