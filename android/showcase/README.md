### 1. Gameplay controls

- Drag from the lower-left play area to open the virtual joystick. It resolves to the eight WASD-style directions,
  with a slight preference for straight movement.
- Drag in the right play area to look and turn.
- Hold the magnifying glass with one finger and tap a target with another to inspect it. Releasing the magnifying
  glass returns to normal play.
- Pause toggles turn-based and real-time play. The icon changes to indicate the available mode switch.
- Attack and Quick Cast execute when released, not continuously while held.
- Quick Cast casts the selected quick spell; if none is selected, it performs a normal attack.
- The green magic button opens the spellbook.
- The top utility bar provides Rest, Journal, Quick Reference, and Menu alongside Gold and Food.

### 2. Inventory and equipment

- Touch and drag an item to move it. Release over a valid inventory cell to place or swap it.
- Release suitable equipment over the paper doll to equip it.
- If the destination is invalid, the item remains held so it can be placed somewhere else.
- Hold the magnifying glass and tap an item to inspect it without moving it.
- Tap a party portrait to change the active character.
- The same inspection modifier is available in relevant inventory, chest, and merchant item views.

### 3. Context-sensitive interaction

[![Annotated context interaction](images/android_3_annotated.png)](images/android_3_annotated.png)

- Aim at a usable door, NPC, item, chest, corpse, mechanism, or map event to reveal a context action.
- Tap the context action to interact with the selected target.
- When an item is held during gameplay, this area becomes a **Drop item** action.
- The small head button toggles the follower panel; the minimap frame provides zoom controls.
- Fly Up and Fly Down controls appear at the right edge only while outdoors with the Fly party buff active.

### 4. Android test character

[![Annotated Android character creation](images/android_4_annotated.png)](images/android_4_annotated.png)

- Normal party creation and its completion checks remain unchanged.
- On Android, the God Lich test character is appended as the final portrait. Pressing the left portrait arrow from
  the first normal portrait wraps directly to it.
- Confirming the God Lich bypasses normal creation checks and starts with that character alone.
- Selecting any normal portrait continues through the standard party-creation path.
